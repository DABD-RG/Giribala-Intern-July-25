# Enhancing Intrusion Detecton Systems Using BERT: A Comparative Study on Benchmark Datasets
With the growing complexity and frequency of cyberattacks, we have serious challenges that need to be addressed in the existing Intrusion Detection System (IDS). 
Traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promise, but fail to adapt to the nuanced and evolving nature of threats in modern times. 
In this research paper, we present BERT-IDS, a transformer-based approach to capture the contextual understanding of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from 
Transformers (BERT) for intrusion detection. The model is thoroughly evaluated against several widely used ML and DL algorithms â€“ namely Random Forest, 
Support Vector Machines, Autoencoders, XGBoost, Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). BERT-IDS's performance was closely observed 
across multiple performance metrics (e.g. accuracy, recall, precision), which demonstrated extreme robustness when compared with the values of traditional ML and DL models. 
The outcomes emphasize the potential of transformer architectures in augmenting the adaptability and flexibility of IDS in the ever-changing cybersecurity environments.
