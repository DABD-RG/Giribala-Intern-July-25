# Enhancing Intrusion Detecton Systems Using BERT: A Comparative Study on Benchmark Datasets
With the growing complexity and frequency of cyberattacks, we face serious challenges in the existing Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS).
Traditional Machine Learning (ML) and Deep Learning (DL) models have shown promise, but they often fail to adapt to the nuanced and evolving nature of modern threats.

In this research, we present BERT-IDS, a transformer-based approach that leverages the contextual understanding power of Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT) for intrusion detection.

## Datasets Considered
- CICIDS2017 (access with link: https://bit.ly/3JfPV17)
- UNSW-NB15 (present in the repo)
- NSL-KDD (present in the repo)

## Models Trained for Comparison
- CNN (Convolutional Neural Network)
- LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)
- RF (Random Forest)
- Autoencoder
- NB (Naive Bayes)
- SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- XGBoost

## Why BERT?
BERT excels at capturing **contextual semantics** within sequences. In cybersecurity, where packet sequences or logs contain subtle patterns, understanding context is critical.
Key reasons for using BERT in IDS:
- Learns **deep contextual relationships** in data
- Captures **bidirectional dependencies**
- Adapts well to **evolving threat patterns**
- Outperforms traditional models on multiple metrics
